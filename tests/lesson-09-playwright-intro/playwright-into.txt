What is Playwright?
- open source framework
- a way to create reliable E2E tests for modern websites
- cre–∞ted by Microsoft (the team that build Pyppeteer)
- its one API
- cross platform (win, linux, macOS)
- cross browser (chromium (channels support all chrome based browsers), webkit, firefox)
- you can use JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java and .NET (c#)
- supports mobile emulation testing

Why use Playwright?
- resilient tests:
- aut-wait - waits for elements to be actionable to perform any actions
- uses the Jest Assertion library under the hood
- web-first asseritions - playwright assertion targeted for dynamic web testing
- they will automatically retry until a condition is met
- many debugers: retrace, traceing, creating videos, screenshots and many others
- fast execution, new browser context for each test (new browser profile), very fast
- re use authentication between tests
- powerful tools: CodeGen (generates code), Inspector (selectors / locators helper), Tracing / Traceviewer (debug)
- very few limitations - multi tab, origin and window support, iframe support, pierce the shadow dom, make API request

Playwright Implementation and CodeGen examples:
- pick browser (project)
- pick lockator
- record new
- basic test structure: imports, test syntax, actions, assertions
