// Homework 03 - Collections and Loops

// Exercise 1: Loop over and array and log items only if the item's length is over 4 characters
// Step 1: Declare an array with the colors: "red","blue","green","yellow","purple","orange","white","black"
// Step 2: Use a for loop to iterate over the array and check if the length of each item is greater than 4 characters
// Step 3: Log the item if the condition is met

// Exercise 2: Write a script to log in the console all numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop

// Excercise 3: Write a script to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop:
// *
// * *
// * * *
// * * * *
// * * * * *
// * * * *
// * * *
// * *
// *

// Exercise 4: Phone number area code substitution
// Step 1: Declare an array with string phone number values "0376829209", "04239982009", "0536829299"
// Step 2: Use a for loop to iterate over the array and replace the "0" in the front with "+359"
// Step 3: Log the original and the new phone numbers in the console

// Exercise 5: Decide on an evening activity
// Step 1: Declare 4 variable Tuple with: name (string), hour (whole number), money (floating point values number) and if person is sick (boolean).
// Step 2: Write a conditional statement that decides on an evening activity based on the following rules:
// - if the person is not sick and has at least 20 money the activity is "go to the cinema"
// - if the person is not sick and has less then 20 money the activity is "go to the park"
// - if the person is not sick and has more then 20 money, but its late at night (hour is between 21 and 24), the activity is "watch a movie"
// - if the person is sick, the activity is "stay at home and go to bed"
// Step 3: Log the person's details and the decided activity.

// Exercise 6: Use an Enum, Object type and Arrays
// Step 1: Declare an enum of Account Types with the following values: "Current" = 1, "FlexSave" = 4, "Deposit" = 2
// Step 2: Declare 3 objects with client data containing their name and their card account types as enum values: 
// {
//   name: "John Doe",
//   accountType: referance the Enum here and assign the account a value,
// }
// Step 3: Add the objects to an array and use a for loop to iterate over the array and log the name and account type of each client in the console
